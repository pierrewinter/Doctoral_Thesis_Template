# Doctoral Thesis Template
This template was created using LaTeX and is currently
set up as a doctoral thesis for ETH Zurich. This can be
easily changed to fit your needs and your institution by
using your own .sty styles. If you like this style, simply
replace the names and dates as you see fit.

## Usage:

Ensure that you have installed both a LaTeX compiler
(MIKTEX, TEXLIVE, etc.)
and a LaTeX editor (TEXMAKER, TEXSTUDIO, WINEDT, etc.).

Open the main [thesis.tex](thesis.tex) file with your editor of choice.
Compile the document using latex or pdflatex 
(this can usually be done through your editor).
The directory structure is organized so that you 
can edit and compile your document one chapter at a time.
All chapters should be in the [chapters](chapters) directory and all
images should be in the [img](img) directory.

I tried to keep the formatting and inputs to a minimum,
but if you need help consult the [LaTeX_manual](LaTeX_manual.pdf) provided here
or visit [tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com).

Good luck on your writing! :muscle:
